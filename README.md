# MinecraftRandomizerDatabase
This is a database for the 'Join.Performium.co' minecraft servers randomizer UHC game mode.
The game isn't actually randomized and you can find how to get certain items by using the console application in this repository.
If you like using this and find more ways to get certain good items, I would appreciate, if you would be able to provide me with a spreadsheet of your findings.
Thank you! And happy games!
